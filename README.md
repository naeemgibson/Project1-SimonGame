Summary
A short description of the game.
Creating a virtual replication of the toy game Simon. A user is presented a light/sound pattern corresponding to four different color buttons. The user must perfectly mimic the pattern presented to complete the level. If the wrong button is pressed in regular mode the user gets an opportunity to repeat the level. In pro mode, the user must complete each level in one try or they are sent to the beginning of the game. The game ends at level 16.
